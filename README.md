# VIC
VIC is a bioinformatics software tool for the interpretation of sequence variants in cancer by the AMP-ASCO-CAP 2017 standards and guidelines. The input to VIC is an annotated file generated by ANNOVAR or un-annotated AVinput/VCF files, while the output of VIC is the classification of variants into 'Benign', 'Likely benign', 'Uncertain significance', 'Likely pathogenic' and 'Pathogenic', together with detailed evidence scores.
